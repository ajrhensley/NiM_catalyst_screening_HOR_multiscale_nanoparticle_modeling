## Article Abstract
Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical to the drive towards increased sustainability for a wide range of industrial chemical processes. Ni-based bimetallic catalysts (NiM) show promise to replace expensive Pt-based catalysts. However, the effect of dopant choice and reaction conditions on the adsorbate-driven surface reconstruction of NiM nanoparticles remains largely unexplored. Here, we use a multiscale modeling approach to investigate the interplay between dopant choice, reaction conditions, facet, adsorbate type, adsorbate coverage, in situ surface structure, and performance for NiM nanoparticles during HOR. Integrating density functional theory (DFT), kubic harmonics interpolation, and microkinetic modeling, we perform a comprehensive analysis of 14 transition metal dopants. Clear periodic table trends appear in dopant effects on H*, O*, and OH* adsorption energies, with the dopants showing 7-fold greater effects when located in the surface layer as compared to subsurface layer. Multi-faceted nanoparticle models showed a non-uniform correlation between O* coverage and degree of surface reconstruction, with no discernable periodic table trends in surface reconstruction. HOR performance was facet-dependent, with the highest performance occurring at reactive fronts formed between regions of high O* and OH* coverage. The average performance over each NiM nanoparticle showed promotional effects for nearly all dopants compared to pure Ni, with the best-performing dopants located preferentially in the surface layer (e.g. Au, Pd, Ag). Taken together, this work emphasizes the importance of understanding the interplay between reaction conditions, surface reconstruction, and HOR performance for NiM nanoparticles, enabling researchers to both predict and control the working nanoscale catalyst structure.
